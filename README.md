This project is a lightweight 2D robotics simulation built using Pygame. It provides a simple environment for testing movement, sensor interaction, and basic autonomous behaviors in a simulated space. The goal is to experiment with robotics algorithms without requiring hardware or resource-intensive simulations like ROS 2 and Gazebo.
